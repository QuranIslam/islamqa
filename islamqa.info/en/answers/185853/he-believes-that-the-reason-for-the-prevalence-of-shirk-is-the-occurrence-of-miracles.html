            <div>
                There are many religious divine people/powers considered as gurus , angels , paighamber , prophets etc .....why Allah put powers in them to do miracles ? and also why Allah put the facilities in them to fulfill people desires and wishes ?
<br>
This is biggest reason of Shirk.......people follow these powers because they reduce their problems , complete wishes ......there are many incidents of such happening in all other respective religious books .
<br>
So tell me why pleasing their powers other than Allah people are living a peaceful life and how their dreams are fulfilled and how their problems disappears if they recites some lines written in their books
<br>
All other powers and books other than Allah came to show only the path of One God what who decided that these powers and books will also solve problems and fulfill desires .
<br>
People are getting benefits thats why they are following that their is no doubt in that .

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Praise be to Allah.</p><p>Frankly, 
    your question needs to be thoroughly reviewed to establish whether it is in 
    accordance with proper understanding of Islamic principles or the reality of 
    life.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You ask at 
    the beginning of your question: why has Allah given the Prophets, the angels 
    and awliya’ spiritual power that enables them to perform miracles? Why did 
    Allah make it easy for them to fulfil people’s desires and wishes? But that 
    is not true in the first place. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has 
    not given the angels and awliya’ any power that enables them to perform 
    miracles. This is one of the mistaken notions that are widespread in many 
    Muslim countries, and has been believed for many centuries among the common 
    folk. However the scholars and fuqaha’ have highlighted these errors and 
    myths to the people, and have explained that Allah, may He be glorified and 
    exalted, has not given anyone special powers to the exclusion of all other 
    people, which he may use whenever and however he wishes. Anyone who make 
    such a claim must bring shar‘i proof from the Qur’an and saheeh Sunnah, but 
    he will never find anything to help him to establish that; thus it will 
    become clear that he has made a mistake or that he is lying, if he said that 
    deliberately.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In fact 
    the Holy Qur’an is full of verses which highlight the weakness and 
    helplessness of all created beings, and tells us that they are in need of 
    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and that they cannot do anything to 
    benefit themselves or ward off harm, either independently or in conjunction 
    with others. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of 
    the meaning):</p>
    <p>“Say (O 
    Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him to mankind): ‘How do you 
    worship besides Allah something which has no power either to harm or to 
    benefit you? But it is Allah Who is the All-Hearer, All-Knower’”</p>
    <p>
    [al-Maa’idah 5:76]</p>
    <p>“Say (O 
    Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ‘I possess no power of 
    benefit or hurt to myself except as Allah wills. If I had the knowledge of 
    the Ghaib (unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, 
    and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad 
    tidings unto people who believe’”</p>
    <p>
    [al-A‘raaf 7:188].</p>
    <p>If the 
    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) – who is the leader of 
    mankind and the dearest of creation to Allah, may He be exalted – was 
    affected by harm, hardship and sickness, and his Lord, may He be exalted, 
    instructed him to tell the people that he possessed no power of benefit or 
    harm for himself except whatever Allah willed, then how could he possess any 
    such power to affect anyone else? Who has the right, after that, to claim 
    that he has the power to benefit or harm anyone, or to bring about miracles 
    or events that are contrary to the laws of nature? This is repeated in 
    Soorah Yoonus (v. 49), in which Allah, may He be glorified, says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): </p>
    <p>“Say (O 
    Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ‘I have no power over 
    any harm or profit to myself except what Allah may will. For every Ummah (a 
    community or a nation), there is a term appointed; when their term is 
    reached, neither can they delay it nor can they advance it an hour (or a 
    moment)’”</p>
    <p>[Yoonus 
    10:49].</p>
    <p>It is also 
    explained clearly in the verse in which Allah, may He be glorified and 
    exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
    <p>“Say (O 
    Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ‘I don’t tell you that 
    with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell 
    you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration.’ 
    Say: ‘Are the blind and the one who sees equal? will you not then take 
    thought?’”</p>
    <p>
    [al-An‘aam 6:50].</p>
    <p>Before the 
    time of our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), Nooh (peace 
    be upon him) was commanded to say something similar, as Allah, may He be 
    exalted, tells us (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
    <p>“ ‘And 
    I do not say to you that with me are the Treasures of Allah, Nor that I know 
    the Ghaib (unseen); "nor do I say I am an angel, and I do not say of those 
    whom your eyes look down upon that Allah will not bestow any good on them. 
    Allah knows what is in their inner-selves (as regards belief, etc.). In that 
    case, I should, indeed be one of the Zalimoon (wrong-doers, oppressors, 
    etc.)’”</p>
    <p>[Hood 
    11:31].</p>
    <p>These 
    Prophets (who are the noblest of mankind and the closest of them to Allah, 
    may He be exalted, were forbidden to claim to have any authority, power or 
    ability to bestow provision, and they were commanded to direct all people to 
    address their needs to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and to focus 
    their hearts and minds on the Lord, the Creator, may He be glorified and 
    exalted. As for created beings, they are all needy and weak, no matter how 
    high their status may be. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of 
    the meaning):</p>
    <p>“O 
    mankind! it is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah is Rich (Free of 
    all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise”</p>
    <p>[Faatir 
    35:15].</p>
    <p>With 
    regard to the miracles of the Prophets, they are unique to them in certain 
    situations, and are not applicable at all times, with the exception of the 
    miracle of the Holy Qur’an, which will remain until the end of time. All the 
    other miracles were for a specific purpose, which was to prove Prophethood 
    to the people; they were not aimed at misguiding people or make them feel 
    attached to a particular power that a person possessed, whether he was a 
    Prophet or a Messenger. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of 
    the meaning):</p>
    <p>
    “Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ‘Allah is the third of the three 
    (in a Trinity).’ But there is no ilaah (god) (none who has the right to be 
    worshipped) but One Ilaah (God -Allah). And if they cease not from what they 
    say, verily, a painful torment will befall the disbelievers among them.</p>
    <p>Will 
    they not repent to Allah and ask His Forgiveness? For Allah is 
    Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
    <p>The 
    Messiah (‘Eesa (Jesus)), son of Maryam (Mary), was no more than a Messenger; 
    many were the Messengers that passed away before him. His mother (Maryam 
    (Mary)) was a Siddeeqah (i.e. she believed in the words of Allah and His 
    Books). They both used to eat food (as any other human being, while Allah 
    does not eat). Look how We make the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, 
    lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) clear to them, yet look how they are 
    deluded away (from the truth).</p>
    <p>Say (O 
    Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him to mankind): ‘How do you 
    worship besides Allah something which has no power either to harm or to 
    benefit you? But it is Allah Who is the All-Hearer, All-Knower.’”</p>
    <p>
    [al-Maa’idah 5:73-76].&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Think 
    about how Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, denounced those who were 
    confused by the miracles of the Messiah ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon 
    him); they took them out of the context in which the Messiah had brought 
    them, which was only to confirm his Prophethood, and they took those 
    miracles as a means to associate others with Allah, may He be exalted, based 
    on the claim that the Messiah possessed a unique and far-reaching ability, 
    granted by Allah, may He be exalted, to raise the dead and heal the sick; 
    this claim is the cause of confusion and trouble. Moreover, it should be 
    understood that over and above all that, these miracles could only come 
    about by the decree, creation and authority of Allah, and by His leave, as 
    we clearly see in the story of ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him). His 
    miracles did not come about by virtue of independent power, or by complete 
    license from Allah (to perform miracles at any time); rather these were 
    temporary situations in which Allah caused miracles to occur at the hand of 
    His Prophet, then that ceased. Hence Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, 
    followed that with a reminder to these people of the human nature of the 
    Messiah and his mother, and their human helplessness and weakness, as He 
    said: “Say (O Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him to 
    mankind): ‘How do you worship besides Allah something which has no power 
    either to harm or to benefit you?” [al-Maa’idah 5:76].&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Thus 
    miracles were brought by the Messengers and Prophets for a specific purpose, 
    which was to confirm Prophethood and no more. This implies that use of 
    miracles was limited to appropriate times and places, and was not a matter 
    in which the individual Prophet or Messenger was given free rein.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The 
    Messiah (peace be upon him) – despite his dazzling miracles of raising the 
    dead by Allah’s leave – was not able to ward off the aggressors who wanted 
    to crucify him, until Allah took him up to Him and caused one of his 
    companions to resemble him. And when the disciples asked him to bring down 
    the table from heaven, he was not able to do that except by asking and 
    beseeching Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Moosa 
    (peace be upon him) fled with the Children of Israel from the aggression of 
    Pharaoh and his people; he did not use his staff except when Allah 
    instructed him to do so, then He parted the sea and made it easy for them to 
    escape.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When the 
    disbelievers of Quraysh grew stubborn in demanding signs from our Prophet 
    Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), it was as if they 
    thought that he had absolute powers to bring about miracles however and 
    whenever he wanted. The response to all of that was two words which will 
    give an answer to all your confusion; these words are an expression of 
    amazement at their stubbornness and their misunderstanding of the true 
    nature of Prophethood. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says:</p>
    <p>“And 
    they say: ‘We shall not believe in you (O Muhammad blessings and peace of 
    Allah be upon him), until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth 
    for us;</p>
    <p>‘Or you 
    have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth in 
    their midst abundantly;</p>
    <p>‘Or you 
    cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as you have pretended, or you 
    bring Allah and the angels before (us) face to face;</p>
    <p>‘Or you 
    have a house of adornable materials (like silver and pure gold, etc.), or 
    you ascend up into the sky, and even then we will put no faith in your 
    ascension until you bring down for us a Book that we would read.’ Say (O 
    Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ‘Glorified (and Exalted) 
    be my Lord (Allah) above all that evil they (polytheists) associate with 
    Him! Am I anything but a man, sent as a Messenger?’”</p>
    <p>
    [al-Isra’ 17:90-93].</p>
    <p>In 
    contrast to the miracles of the Prophets, which are the greatest causes of 
    guidance, we find the fitnah (trial or test) of the Dajjaal, and what Allah 
    will cause to happen at his hands of extra ordinary feats, which are the 
    greatest of tests and the most dangerous causes of misguidance, as it says 
    in the hadeeth of an-Nawwaas ibn Sam‘aan (may Allah be pleased with him), 
    according to which the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) 
    spoke of the Dajjaal and said: “He will come to a people and call them, and 
    they will believe in him and respond to his call. Then he will command the 
    sky and it will rain, and he will command the earth and it will bring forth 
    produce. Their herds will come back to them in the evening with their humps 
    as high as they ever were and their udders full and their flanks stretched. 
    Then he will come to another people and call them, and they will reject what 
    he says, so he will leave them and they will be afflicted with drought, with 
    none of their wealth in their hands. He will pass by ruins and say: Bring 
    forth your treasure, and its treasure will follow him like a swarm of bees. 
    Then he will call a man brimming with youth and will strike him with a sword 
    and cut him in two. He will place the pieces as far apart as a target is 
    from an archer, then he will call him and he will come with his face 
    gleaming and laughing.”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Despite 
    all these feats, he will be one eyed, and he will not have the power to 
    restore his own eye in his face. Between his eyes will be written the word 
    “kaafir” (disbeliever), and he will not have the power to erase it or change 
    it. The Messiah ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him) will kill him, and he 
    will not have the power to ward off killing from himself. It was narrated 
    from Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger 
    of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) spoke of the Dajjaal and 
    said: “He will come but it will be forbidden to him to enter the mountain 
    passes of Madinah. So he will go to the barren tracts near Madinah and on 
    that day a man will go out to him who is the best of mankind or one of the 
    best of mankind, and he will say to him: I bear witness that you are the 
    Dajjaal of whom the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
    him) spoke. The Dajjaal will say: If I kill this man and bring him back to 
    life, do you think that you will have any doubts about the matter? They will 
    say: No. So he will kill him then bring him back to life, and when he is 
    brought back to life he will say: By Allah, I was never more certain of you 
    than I am now. He said: The Dajjaal will want to kill him but he will not be 
    able to do so.” Narrated by Muslim (2938).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So the 
    believer is the one who seeks the protection of Allah, may He be glorified 
    and exalted, and is not deceived by those extraordinary feats or and does 
    not believe that they are signs of divinity or sufficient reason to worship 
    anyone other than Allah, may He be glorified. If he ponders the matter 
    briefly – as explained above – he will realise the difference between 
    divinity and servitude. The Holy Qur’an clearly highlights this great 
    difference and points out that this is a test and a trial for humanity, for 
    this world is basically the realm of tests and trials. Allah, may He be 
    exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
    <p>“If 
    Allah willed, He would have made you one nation, but that (He) may test you 
    in what He has given you; so strive as in a race in good deeds. The return 
    of you (all) is to Allah; then He will inform you about that in which you 
    used to differ”</p>
    <p>
    [al-Maa’idah 5:48]</p>
    <p>“Who 
    has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in 
    deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving”</p>
    <p>Al-Mulk 
    67:2]</p>
    <p>“And He 
    it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne 
    was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds”</p>
    <p>[Hood 
    11:7].</p>
    <p>With 
    regard to being deceived by tales that are told of relieving hardship, 
    resolving problems and dispelling worries and concerns by seeking the help 
    of those who claim to perform miracles and have extraordinary powers, 
    whether they are Muslims or otherwise, this is also one of the causes of 
    misguidance for the sons of Adam. No one is doomed by this except one who 
    does not understand the reality of faith and is deceived by some stories.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Shaykh 
    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It should 
    be understood that the reason why the Christians and others who also went to 
    extremes, such as the extreme worshippers and the Shi ‘ah and others, went 
    astray, is due to three things:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    1.Ambiguous and unclear words, 
    that are general in meaning, that were narrated from the Prophets; those 
    people ignored the clear, unambiguous words, and clung to these (ambiguous) 
    words. Every time they heard something that could be interpreted in support 
    of their specious arguments, they clung to it and interpreted it in 
    accordance with their views, even if there was no evidence to that effect. 
    But with regard to clear and unambiguous words that were contrary to that, 
    they either say Allah knows best what it means, or they misinterpret them as 
    the followers of misguidance do. They follow ambiguous evidence, whether it 
    is rational or textual, and they turn away from clear, unambiguous evidence 
    of both types. </p>
    <p>
    2.Extraordinary feats that they 
    think are signs or miracles, but they are the tricks of the devils. This is 
    something that caused many of the mushrikeen and others to go astray, such 
    as when the devils enter the idols and speak to the people, or when the 
    devils tell the soothsayers about matters of the unseen, but they mix it 
    with lies. And there are other actions that the devils do. 
    </p>
    <p>
    3.Reports which were transmitted 
    to them and they thought they were true, when in fact they were false. 
    Otherwise neither the Christians nor any other misguided group has any 
    evidence to support their falsehood, whether it is based on clear rational 
    thinking or sound texts, nor do they have any sign or miracle of the 
    Prophets. </p>
    <p>End quote 
    from al-Jawaab as-Saheeh (2/315)&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the 
    third reason there is a response to what you say in your question: “why 
    pleasing their powers other than Allah people are leaving a peaceful life 
    and how their dreams are fulfilled and how their problems disappear if they 
    recite some lines written in their books?” The questioner confirms that most 
    of what you hear of such things is clearly lies or rumours and exaggeration. 
    Otherwise, let these charlatans produce those solutions that they claim to 
    have for all of humanity, or at least for their own people, and let them 
    save everyone around them from poverty, sickness, unemployment and other 
    misfortunes.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>All of 
    that and other things are legitimate questions for us to put to you, and we 
    do not understand how anyone in the twenty-first century, when knowledge and 
    understanding have become widespread among people, could think in such an 
    irrational manner and start again to believe that there could be any human 
    being who possesses any power independent of Allah, may He be glorified and 
    exalted, that will enable him, by reciting a few lines or doing some tricks 
    and extraordinary feats, to change the life of any person.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>But if 
    what you meant is that the followers of the Prophets can make problems 
    disappear from their lives by merely reciting a few lines from their books, 
    this is also clearly wrong and far removed from any understanding of the 
    true nature of the Prophets’ call and how their followers lived. First of 
    all, we say to you that the virtue of following the Prophet (blessings and 
    peace of Allah be upon him) and adhering to his teachings and message, is 
    not attained merely by reciting a few lines from their books. Rather that 
    requires a fundamental change in lifestyle and way of thinking, in order to 
    follow the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in an exact 
    manner.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Allah, may 
    He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
    <p>“And 
    verily, this (i.e. Allah’s Commandments) is my Straight Path, so follow it, 
    and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. 
    This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”</p>
    <p>[al-An 
    ‘aam 6:153]</p>
    <p>“Say (O 
    Muhammad blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): ‘Verily, my Salat 
    (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of 
    the Alameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists).</p>
    <p>‘He has 
    no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the 
    Muslims”</p>
    <p>
    [al-An‘aam 6:162-163].&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Moreover 
    we say to you: the problems and hardships of life, such as poverty, sickness 
    and loss of loved ones – all these trials and tribulations were not absent 
    from the lives of the Prophets or their followers. This world is based on 
    trials and tests, in accordance with the great wisdom of Allah. But what was 
    absent from their lives was distress, misery, misguidance and despair, no 
    matter what the trials they faced!&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We need to 
    contemplate the Book of Allah, may He be exalted, and the Sunnah of the 
    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in order to 
    understand the real meaning of the message of Tawheed (affirmation of the 
    Oneness of Allah) that Islam brought. We should not be confused by the myths 
    of the liars and charlatans who deceive the people with some tricks or 
    claims of “miracles” when they are the farthest of people from the path of 
    righteousness. “Miracles” (karaamah) can only be by the action of Allah, and 
    He is the only One Who can bestow that, and that can only be attained as a 
    result of the blessing of following the Prophet. Allah, may He be exalted, 
    may cause them to happen at a person’s hands because he is in a situation in 
    which he needs this help, or to establish proof of the soundness of his 
    religion against those who oppose him. Moreover the basic principle with 
    regard to these miracles is that it is to be concealed and it should remain 
    a matter between the pious slave and friend of Allah and his Lord, may He be 
    glorified. With regard to those who boast of such feats, if they were truly&nbsp; 
    following the straight path, they would not boast about it or show off to 
    the people about it, or try to consume their wealth thereby or use those 
    feats for their own purposes; rather this is the way of the charlatans and 
    those who devour haraam wealth, as as-Subki (may Allah have mercy on him) 
    said: “The mu‘jizah (miracle) may be accompanied by claims of Prophethood, 
    which is not so in the case of karaamah (extraordinary feats) … Moreover the 
    mu‘jizah is meant to be done openly and be seen and known by many people, 
    and the one for whom it is done (the Prophet) is enjoined to show it openly, 
    whereas the karaamah is based on concealment and the one for whom it is done 
    (the wali or close friend of Allah) is enjoined to conceal it, and not to 
    make it known except in rare cases to very few, not to make it public 
    knowledge to many people. Moreover the mu‘jizah may be any extraordinary 
    event; the karaamah can only be of a few types, as was explained by 
    al-Qushayri, and this is the correct view.</p>
    <p>
    End quote from Tabaqaat ash-Shaafa‘iyyah al-Kubra 
    (2/317)&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It should 
    be understood that by the mercy of Allah, may He be exalted, to His slaves, 
    and by His wisdom in all that He creates and in His commands and 
    prohibitions, he granted to the Messengers and Prophets that which will 
    offer proof to their people so that they will believe in them, because He, 
    may He be exalted, loves to establish proof for His slaves (so that there 
    will be no excuse) and He loves for them to be guided to the straight path. 
    And whoever takes that as a means to become attached to the Prophets in a 
    manner that is appropriate only for a slave in relation to his Lord and for 
    a person in relation to his Creator, may He be glorified, and asks them to 
    meet his needs in a manner which no one is able to do except Allah, then he 
    has wronged himself and he should not blame anyone but his own self that is 
    inclined towards evil, and that is the source of all wrong doing and 
    misguidance. He should know that his path is one thing, and the call of the 
    Prophets is something else altogether; their call is that which is summed up 
    in the verse in Soorat al-Faatihah (interpretation of the meaning): “You 
    (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help” [al-Faatihah 1:5].&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We have 
    much that we could say about your questions, but we hope that what we have 
    mentioned will be a sufficient summary.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>And Allah 
    knows best. </p>
