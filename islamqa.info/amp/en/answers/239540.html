        Do the principles of the sciences of Hadeeth have a basis in the Quraan and Sunnah? For example, is there any evidence speaking of the legislated nature of using the isnaad, or guidelines about how to differentiate the saheeh from the daeef and the correct from the shaadhdh and is there evidence speaking about the legislated nature of Al-Jarh Wat-Ta'deel? Or is it that the Muhaddithoon made these themselves for the purpose of trying to preserve the sunnah, even if they did not find evidence for it from the Qur'aan and the Sunnah?    </div>

    <section class="content-container">
      <p>Praise be to Allah.</p><p>
	The science of hadith is basically and in principle founded 
	on rational guidelines, with a methodology based on an accumulation of 
	experience attained by the hadith scholars on the basis of many years’ 
	experience of narrating reports and checking their authenticity and 
	soundness. They attained the basis of this knowledge through lengthy 
	involvement in checking reports, seeking them out, conveying them, examining 
	them and determining whether there were any faults in them, thus gradually 
	developing the general guidelines and framework of the science of hadith. 
	Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi said: Distinguishing the soundness of hadith is a 
	kind of knowledge that Allah, may He be exalted, creates in people’s hearts 
	after they have spent a great deal of time in this field and have attained 
	lengthy involvement therein.</p>
	<p>
	Al-Jaami‘ 
	(2/255).</p>
	<p>
	But at the same time, these general guidelines – in their 
	general philosophy, but not in their minor details – are derived from some 
	shar‘i principles that are mentioned in the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah. 
	There are general shar‘i texts that outline to the scholars of hadith the 
	basic principles of the science of history and reports. As for the details, 
	they were left to be developed through the accumulation of practice and 
	experience, as referred to above.</p>
	<p>
	Some of these general shar‘i principles are as follows:</p>
	<p>
	1.
	
	The stern 
	prohibition on lying about hadiths (narration from the Prophet (blessings 
	and peace of Allah be upon him)), as the Prophet (blessings and peace of 
	Allah be upon him) said: “Lying about me is not like lying about anyone 
	else. Whoever tells a lie about me deliberately, let him take his place in 
	Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1295) and Muslim (4 – in the Introduction to 
	his Saheeh).</p>
	<p>
	2.
	
	Not accepting the report of an evildoer. Allah, may He be 
	exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “O 
	you who believe! If a Fasiq (liar — evil person) comes to you with any news, 
	verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you 
	become regretful for what you have done” 
	[al-Hujuraat 49:6].</p>
	<p>
	3.
	
	Stipulation that 
	the narrator should be of good character, by analogy with the requirement 
	for a witness to be of good character. Allah, may He be exalted, says 
	(interpretation of the meaning): 
	“And take as 
	witness two just persons from among you (Muslims). And establish the 
	testimony for Allah” [at-Talaaq 65:2].</p>
	<p>
	4.
	
	Constant 
	verification and checking. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of 
	the meaning): 
	“And follow not 
	(O man i.e., say not, or do not or witness not) that of which you have no 
	knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of 
	those one will be questioned (by Allah)” [al-Isra’ 17:36].</p>
	<p>
	5.
	
	Warning against 
	odd and weird reports. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be 
	pleased with him) that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
	him) said: “At the end of time there will be liars and charlatans who will 
	bring ahaadeeth that neither you nor your forefathers ever heard. Beware of 
	them and stay away from them, and do not let them mislead you or confuse 
	you.” Narrated by Muslim in the Introduction to his Saheeh (7).</p>
	<p>
	6.
	
	Refraining from 
	knowingly narrating a report that is a lie, as the Prophet (blessings and 
	peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever narrates a hadeeth from me 
	knowing that it is false is one of the liars.” Narrated by Muslim in the 
	Introduction to his Saheeh.</p>
	<p>
	7.
	
	Precise 
	memorisation is the basis of trustworthiness. The Prophet (blessings and 
	peace of Allah be upon him) said: “May Allah bless a man who hears a hadeeth 
	from us and memorizes it so that he can convey it to others, for perhaps he 
	is conveying it to one who will understand it better than him, and perhaps 
	the one who conveys knowledge does not understand it himself.” Narrated by 
	Abu Dawood in his Sunan (3660).</p>
	<p>
	8.
	
	Warning against 
	putting oneself under suspicion by narrating a lot of weird reports and not 
	being selective in what one narrates. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may 
	Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace 
	of Allah be upon him) said: “It is sufficient lying for a man to speak of 
	everything that he hears.” Narrated by Muslim in the Introduction to his 
	Saheeh.</p>
	<p>
	9.
	
	Seeking evidence and proof. Allah, may He be exalted, says 
	(interpretation of the meaning): “Say 
	(O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)), ‘Produce your proof 
	if you are truthful’” 
	[al-Baqarah 2:111].
	</p>
	<p>
	10.Seeking 
	certain knowledge, far removed from speculation and illusion. Allah, may He 
	be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): 
	“But 
	they have no knowledge thereof. They follow but conjecture, and verily, 
	conjecture is no substitute for the truth” 
	[an-Najm 53:28].
	</p>
	<p>
	Some of these texts were quoted as evidence by Imam Muslim 
	(may Allah have mercy on him) in the Introduction to his Saheeh (p. 
	7), where he said:</p>
	<p>You should 
	know, may Allah guide you, that it is obligatory for everyone who can 
	distinguish between sound and unsound reports, and between trustworthy and 
	dubious narrators, not to narrate any report unless he is sure of the 
	soundness and honesty of their narrators, and to avoid those which are 
	narrated by dubious narrators and those who stubbornly follow bid ah 
	(innovation).</p>
	<p>The evidence 
	for what we are saying and that it should not be any other way is the words 
	of Allah, may He be blessed and exalted:</p>
	<p>“O you who 
	believe! If a Faasiq (liar — evil person) comes to you with any news, verify 
	it, lest you should harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become 
	regretful for what you have done”</p>
	<p>[al-Hujuraat 
	49:6]</p>
	<p>“such as 
	you agree for witnesses”</p>
	<p>[al-Baqarah 
	2:282]</p>
	<p>“And take 
	as witness two just persons from among you (Muslims)”</p>
	<p>[al-Talaaq 
	65:2].</p>
	<p>The verses 
	that we have quoted prove that the report of a faasiq (liar or evil person) 
	is to be rejected and not accepted, and that the testimony of one who is not 
	just is to be rejected.</p>
	<p>Even though a 
	report is not the same as testimony in some ways, they are fundamentally the 
	same because the report of a faasiq is not acceptable according to the 
	scholars, just as his testimony is rejected by all of them. The Sunnah 
	indicates that munkar reports are to be rejected just as the Qur’an 
	indicates that the report of a faasiq is to be rejected. 
	End quote.</p>
	<p>
	Dr. Humaam Sa‘eed says:</p>
	<p>
	Thus it becomes clear to us that the methodology of the 
	hadith scholars is a Qur’anic methodology that is derived from the Qur’an 
	and Sunnah, and that it is a critical methodology that deals with historical 
	reports; in other words, it does not accept a reported text without 
	examining it critically, and it is not sufficient for this text to be 
	narrated from a scholar or a person of respectable standing in order for it 
	to be accepted. Rather it is essential that the attribution of the report to 
	the one who said it should be proven, and it should be examined thoroughly 
	and carefully to make sure that it is in harmony with the proven principles 
	and general guidelines.</p>
	<p>
	This critical methodology that deals with historical reports 
	was absent in the case of the Torah and Gospel, and it was absent in the 
	case of all historical narratives before Islam. Then Islam came to give the 
	world this sound methodology that is based on research, thorough examination 
	and sound thinking. Charles Guinevere contrasted this methodology of 
	critically examining historical events with the Christian methodology that 
	is based on faith, which accepted reports from earlier generations without 
	any discussion or critical examination.</p>
	<p>
	Many researchers overlooked this methodological connection 
	between the Holy Quran and the sciences of hadith, to the extent that many 
	people thought that the methodology of the hadith scholars was the result of 
	a kind of unsurpassed brilliance, and that it developed because of need 
	alone. But the truth that cannot be doubted is that the methodology of the 
	hadith scholars is a Qur’anic methodology, and it is one of the 
	manifestations of the miraculous nature of this religion. Just as Allah 
	protected His holy Book from any changes or alterations, He also preserved 
	the Sunnah as a whole and protected it from vanishing and being forgotten. 
	End quote from al-Fikr al-Manhaji ‘inda al-Muhadditheen (p. 24).</p>
	<p>
	All of the above – as will be clear to the reader – 
	represents general methodological principles that were established by the 
	Holy Qur’an and instilled by our Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be 
	upon him) in the souls of his Companions, so as to set out for them a 
	general framework for the theory of the knowledge that they were seeking to 
	acquire, on which they would found knowledge that was based on reason and on 
	religious texts. So these principles led to a very precise and thorough 
	examination (of the reports) and a critical sense that was well balanced and 
	guided. The reason for that was fear of going against these principles and 
	divine commands. Were it not for that, the Muslims would have indulged in 
	illusions and speculation, and we would have seen myths, fables and 
	contradictions that would have been the common language in the knowledge 
	produced by the Muslims. But the religious deterrent contained in the ten 
	guidelines mentioned above played a major role in the methodology of 
	checking and examining that the hadith scholars developed. 
	</p>
	<p>
	As for precise details about hadith science, which is 
	“learning the rules and regulations on the basis of which scholars study the 
	isnaad (chain of narrators) and matn (text of a hadith), and determine 
	whether it is to be accepted or rejected” – such as their discussion about 
	whether a narrator had a precise memory or not, whether the report is 
	written in a precise manner, the methodology of dealing with reports 
	narrated by those who engaged in tadlees [tadlees 
	is when a narrator narrates a hadeeth that he did not hear directly from his 
	shaykh, without mentioning the name of the third party from whom he heard it], 
	giving precedence to a report that is narrated by one who is more authentic 
	over one who is trustworthy, knowing how to classify the narrators from a 
	particular shaykh, comparing between different reports and collecting hadith 
	with similar texts but different isnaads, exercising deliberation when 
	examining narrators, seeking corroborative reports, regarding a report as 
	strong if there are many versions of it and many isnaads, and other 
	guidelines and regulations that help scholars to determine whether a report 
	is to be accepted or rejected – all of that, as you can see, is the product 
	of detailed rational thinking that translates these general principles into 
	practical methodological rules and regulations by means of which the hadith 
	scholars came to a conclusion in judging whether a hadith was saheeh (sound) 
	or da‘eef (weak).</p>
	<p>
	Al-‘Allaamah al-Mu‘allimi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:</p>
	<p>
	But have they paid attention to reason when accepting a 
	hadith and regarding it as sound?</p>
	<p>
	I say: Yes, they did pay attention to that at four points: 
	when they heard the hadith, when they narrated it, when they passed 
	judgement on the narrators, and when they passed judgement on the hadiths.</p>
	<p>
	When the well-versed scholars in this field heard a report 
	that could not be sound, or was very unlikely to be sound, they did not 
	write it down or memorise it, and if they did memorise it, they did not 
	narrate it to others.</p>
	<p>
	If there is any interest that could be served by mentioning 
	it, they would mention it and follow that by criticism of the report and of 
	the narrator who was at fault. Imam ash-Shaafa‘i said in ar-Risaalah 
	(p. 399): What could be indicative of whether a narrator is telling the 
	truth or lying is when a narrator narrates a report that cannot be true, or 
	that is contrary to another report that is more authentic, or has more 
	evidence to prove it sound. </p>
	<p>
	Al-Khateeb said in al-Kifaayah fi ‘Ilm ar-Riwaayah (p. 
	429): Chapter on the obligation to eliminate odd reports and those that 
	cannot possibly be sound.</p>
	<p>
	There are among narrators a group who are very lenient with 
	regard to what they hear and narrate, but the imams (leading scholars) are 
	lying in wait for the narrators, so you hardly find any hadith that is 
	clearly false, but you will find in its isnaad one or two narrators, or a 
	group of narrators, whom the imams criticised. The imams very often 
	criticise a narrator and regard him as flawed for narrating one munkar (odd) 
	hadith, let alone two or more.</p>
	<p>
	They describe the report that cannot possibly be sound, or is 
	unlikely to be sound, as munkar (odd) or baatil (false). We find this a 
	great deal in the biographies of weak narrators, or in books that speak of 
	flawed and fabricated reports.</p>
	<p>
	The scholars who examined the hadiths would not regard a 
	narrator as credible until they examine his hadiths and check them one by 
	one.</p>
	<p>
	With regard to examining the soundness of hadiths, the 
	scholars are very careful and cautious. Yes indeed, not everyone from whom 
	it was narrated that he regarded a hadith as sound and credible was 
	necessarily a man of deep knowledge, but the one who has knowledge and 
	experience can distinguish between one thing and another.</p>
	<p>
	The leading scholars who examined the hadiths realised that 
	among them are some hadiths that may be difficult for some scholars of 
	kalaam and their ilk to accept, but they found them to be in accordance with 
	reason that is credible according to the religious texts, and that they 
	fulfilled all the other conditions of soundness. Moreover, they found in the 
	Qur’an many verses that are in harmony with it or that speak of the same 
	idea. This is also difficult for the scholars of kalaam to accept, but the 
	hadith scholars know that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
	him) believed in and followed the Qur’an, so it is very possible that he 
	would say things that carry similar meanings to what is in the Qur’an.</p>
	<p>
	End quote from al-Anwaar al-Kaashifah (p. 6-7).</p>
	<p>
	Dr. Khaldoon al-Ahdab said:</p>
	<p>
	The development of usool al-hadith was on a rational basis. 
	Were that not the case, it could never have had this huge impact in shaping 
	the Muslim mind.</p>
	<p>
	This rational development of usool al-hadith began from the 
	methodological and rational principle that is stated in the Holy Qur’an and 
	Sunnah with regard to examining the narrator and what he narrated, on which 
	the science of usool al-hadith is based.</p>
	<p>
	The development of this branch of knowledge may be 
	represented in the fact that the hadith scholars paid attention to reason 
	when examining a hadith to see how sound it is, in four stages, as the great 
	scholar and critic ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Mu‘allimi al-Yamaani said.</p>
	<p>
	End quote from Athar ‘Ilm Usool al-Hadith fi Tashkeel al-‘Aql 
	al-Muslim, (p. 19).</p>
	<p>
	Dr. ‘Abdullah Dayfullah ar-Ruhayli said:</p>
	<p>
	&nbsp;The academic guidelines on verifying reports, according to 
	us Muslims – as in the case of the methodology of the hadith scholars – is 
	not based on belief in the unseen, such that this mystical approach could be 
	one of the guidelines for ascertaining whether a report is sound or not; 
	rather they are rational guidelines that take into account reason, proven 
	historical facts, comparison of reports, or other guidelines that the hadith 
	scholars developed regarding the evidence or proof of the soundness of a 
	report.</p>
	<p>
	These guidelines, as we have described them, are rational and 
	based on common sense, such that all people – or almost all people – will be 
	able to understand and accept them, regardless of their religion or 
	affiliation. A report with an interrupted chain of narrators, for example, 
	is something that all people of sound mind would doubt and would not accept 
	it because of that. That is because there is no continuous chain of 
	narrators going all the way back to the source of the report, and if that is 
	not available, then how can it be imagined that the report is sound?</p>
	<p>
	Human minds can differentiate between a report being certain 
	on the one hand, and it being likely or a mere possibility on the other 
	hand. Therefore there is no room for the question which says, on what 
	academic methodology is the approach of the hadith scholars in verifying a 
	report based? Is it a scientifically-based methodology, or is it a mystical, 
	faith-based methodology? That is because belief in the unseen plays no role 
	in examining and verifying the report, then accepting it or rejecting it. 
	However, this aspect of the hadith scholars’ methodology has to do with 
	verifying reports and is not based on personal opinion or belief in the 
	unseen.</p>
