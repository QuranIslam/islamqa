          When Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up to pray, he used to face the Ka`bah in a standing position, then say ‘Allahu Akbar’, then recite Al-Fatihah, then recite another surah, then make ruku`, then raise up from ruku`, then make sujud, then raise up from sujud, then make a second sujud, then stand up to make the second rak`ah.        </div>

    <section class="content-container">
      <p>Praise be to Allah.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="facing-the-direction-of-the-ka-bah">Facing the direction of the Ka`bah&nbsp;</h3>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li>When you stand up to pray, face the direction of the Ka`bah wherever you are, in both fard (obligatory) and nafl (supererogatory) prayers. This is one of <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/65847/what-are-the-pillars-obligatory-parts-and-sunnah-acts-of-prayer.html" target="_blank">the pillars of prayer</a> , without which prayer is not valid.</li>
	<li>The obligation of facing the direction of prayer does not apply to one who is engaged in warfare, when he prays the fear prayer (<a href="../../../en/answers/36896/index.html">salat al-khawf</a>) or is engaged in heavy fighting. It also does not apply to those who are unable to do it, such as one who is sick, or one who is traveling on a ship, in a car or on a plane, if they fear that the time of the prayer will elapse (before they reach a place where they can find the correct direction). And it does not apply to one who is praying a nafl prayer or witr prayer whilst riding on a riding-animal etc., but it is mustahabb for him to face the qiblah if he is able to do so when pronouncing the takbir of ihram (at the beginning of the prayer), then he may face whatever direction he is facing.</li>
	<li>Everyone who can see the Ka`bah must face it; those who cannot see it must face its direction.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Ruling on not facing the Ka`bah in prayer by mistake&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="4">If a person prays not facing the qiblah, because of clouds [preventing him from working out the direction from the position of the sun] or some other reason, after he did his best to work out the right direction, his prayer is valid and he does not have to repeat it.</li>
	<li value="5">If someone whom he trusts comes – whilst he is praying – and tells him of the right direction, then he must hasten to turn that way, and his prayer is valid.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h3 dir="ltr" id="qiyam-standing-in-prayer">Qiyam (standing in prayer)&nbsp;</h3>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="6">It is obligatory to pray standing. This is a pillar (essential part of prayer), except for the one who is praying the fear prayer or at times of intense fighting, when it is permitted to pray whilst riding; for the one who is sick and unable to stand, he should pray sitting if he is able, otherwise lying on his side; and the one who is praying a nafl prayer, he may pray whilst riding or sitting if he wishes, and he indicates the ruku` and sujud with his head. The one who is sick may also do this, and he should make his sujud lower than his ruku`.</li>
	<li value="7">It is not permissible for one who is praying sitting down to put something raised up on the ground in order to prostrate on it. Rather he should make his sujud lower than his ruku` – as we have mentioned – if he is unable to touch the ground directly with his forehead.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Prayer on board a ship or airplane</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="8">It is permissible to pray fard prayers on board a ship or airplane.</li>
	<li value="9">It is permissible to pray them sitting down if one fears that one may fall.</li>
	<li value="10">It is permissible to lean on a pillar or stick when standing, if one is old or weak in body.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Combining standing and sitting in prayer&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="11">It is permissible to pray <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/143240/what-is-the-difference-between-tahajjud-and-qiyam-al-layl.html" target="_blank">qiyam al-layl</a> standing or sitting with no excuse, or to do both. So a person may pray and recite sitting down, and just before doing ruku` he may stand up and recite the rest of the ayahs standing up, then do ruku` and sujud, then he can do likewise in the second rak`ah.</li>
	<li value="12">If he prays sitting down, he should pray sitting cross-legged or in whatever position he finds comfortable. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Praying wearing shoes &nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="13">It is permissible to pray barefoot, or to pray wearing shoes.</li>
	<li value="14">It is better to pray sometimes barefoot and sometimes wearing shoes, according to what is easy; one should not make it difficult to put shoes on or to take them off in order to pray. If a person is barefoot, he should pray barefoot and if he is wearing shoes then he should pray wearing shoes, except when there is a reason not to do so.</li>
	<li value="15">If he takes them off, then he should not place them to his right; rather he should place them to his left, if there is no one on his left, otherwise he should put them between his feet. There is a subtle hint that he should not place them in front of himself. This is the etiquette which most worshippers ignore, so you see them praying facing their shoes! This is what was narrated in the sahih reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Praying on the minbar&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="16">It is permissible for the imam to pray on an elevated place such as the minbar, in order to teach the people. So he should stand up on it to pray, then say takbir, recite Quran and do ruku` whilst he is on that place, then he should come down backwards so that he can prostrate on the ground at the base of the minbar, then he may go back to it and do the same in the second rak`ah as he did in the first.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>It is obligatory to pray facing a sutrah and be close to it&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="17">It is obligatory to pray facing a sutrah (screen or cover), there is no difference whether that is in the mosque or elsewhere, whether the mosque is big or small, because of the general meaning of the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Do not pray except facing a sutrah, and do not let anyone pass in front of you, and if he insists then fight him, for he has a companion (qarin) with him” – meaning the Shaytan.</li>
	<li value="18">It is obligatory to be close to the sutrah, because this is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded.</li>
	<li value="19">Between the place where the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prostrated and the wall there would be a space nearly big enough for a sheep to pass through. Whoever does that is close enough [to the sutrah] as is required. I say: from this we know that what people do in all the mosques that I have seen in Syria and elsewhere, by praying in the middle of the mosque far away from the wall or pillars is but negligence towards the command and action of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>How high should the sutrah be?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="20"><a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/145200/height-and-width-of-the-sutrah.html" target="_blank">The sutrah should be approximately a handspan</a> or two above the ground, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you places in front of him something such as the stick on the end of a saddle, he should pray and not worry about anyone who passes in front of that.” This hadith indicates that a line on the ground is not sufficient, and the hadith narrated concerning that is da’if (weak).</li>
	<li value="21">He should face the sutrah directly, because this is the apparent meaning of the command to pray towards the sutrah. Stepping slightly to the right or left so that one is not facing it directly, is not correct.</li>
	<li value="22">It is permissible to pray facing a stick planted in the ground and the like, or a tree, or a pillar, or one’s wife lying down in bed underneath her blanket, or an animal, even if it is a camel.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Prohibition of praying towards graves&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="23">It is not permitted to pray facing graves at all, whether they are the grave of prophets or of others.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Prohibition of walking in front of one who is praying even in al-Masjid al-Haram&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="24">It is not permitted to walk in front of one who is praying if there is a sutrah in front of him [i.e., it is not permissible to come between him and his sutrah]. There is no difference in this regard between al-Masjid al-Haram and other mosques, all of them are the same in that this [walking in front of one who is praying] is not permitted, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “If the person who passes in front of one who is praying knew how great a burden of sin resulted from that, standing for forty [years] would be better for him than passing in front of one who is praying.” This refers to passing between him and the place of his prostration. The hadith which speaks of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) praying in Hashiyat al-Mataf without a sutrah and with people passing in front of him is not sahih, even though it does not say that they were passing between him and his place of prostration. It is obligatory for the one who is prostrating to prevent the one who wants to pass in front of him, even in Masjid al-Haram.</li>
	<li value="25">It is not permissible for the one who is praying towards a sutrah to let anyone pass in front of him, because of the hadith quoted above, “Do not let anyone pass in front of you…” And because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you is praying towards something which is a sutrah between him and the people, and someone wants to pass in front of him, then he should push him in the upper chest and repel him as much as he can.” According to another report: “… he should stop him twice, but if he insists then he should fight him, for he is a devil.”&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Stepping forward to prevent someone passing in front of him&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="26">It is permissible for a person to take one or two steps to the front, in order to prevent one who is not responsible from passing in front of him, such as an animal or a small child, and to make them pass behind him.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>What breaks prayer&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="27">The sutrah is so important to prayer that it prevents a person’s prayer from being invalidated, if someone passes in front of him. This is in contrast to the one who does not use a sutrah, whose prayer is broken if an adult woman, a donkey or a black dog passes in front of him. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h3 dir="ltr" id="niyyah-intention">Niyyah (intention)&nbsp;</h3>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="28">The worshipper must have the intention of praying the prayer for which he is standing. He must have the intention in his heart of performing a specific prayer, such as the fard (obligatory prayer) of Zuhr or of ‘Asr, or the Sunnah of those prayers. This is a condition or pillar (essential part) of the prayer, but uttering the intention verbally is a bid’ah which goes against the Sunnah, which was not suggested by any of the imams who are followed.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h3 dir="ltr" id="takbir">Takbir&nbsp;</h3>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="29">Then he should start the prayer by saying “Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great).” This is an essential part of the prayer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The key to prayer is purifying oneself (wudu’), it is entered by takbir (saying ‘Allahu akbar’) and exited by taslim (saying ‘al-salamu ‘alaykum’)” i.e, once you say takbir, certain things are prohibited and this prohibition ends when you say taslim.</li>
	<li value="30">He should not raise his voice when saying takbir in all the prayers, unless he is acting as an imam.</li>
	<li value="31">It is permissible for the muadhdhin to convey the takbir of the imam to the people, if there is a need to do so, such as if the imam is sick and his voice is weak, or because there are many worshippers praying behind him.</li>
	<li value="32">The one who is following the imam should not say takbir until the imam has finished saying takbir.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Raising the hands – how it is to be done&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="33">He should raise his hands when saying the takbir, or before or after doing so. All of these are proven in the Sunnah.</li>
	<li value="34">He should raise them with the fingers stretched out.</li>
	<li value="35">He should raise them level with his shoulders, or sometimes until they are level with his earlobes. I say: with regard to touching the earlobes with the thumbs, there is no basis for this in the Sunnah, rather in my view this has to do with waswas (insinuating whispers of the Shaytan).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Placing the hands – how it is to be done&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="36">Then he should place his right hand on his left, immediately after the takbir. This is the way of the prophets (peace be upon them), and this is what the Messenger of Allah&nbsp; (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined upon his Companions. It is not permissible to let the arms hang at the sides.</li>
	<li value="37">The right hand should be placed on the back of the left hand, wrist and forearm.</li>
	<li value="38">Sometimes the left hand may be grasped with the right. The combination of placing and grasping, which was favoured by some later scholars, has no basis. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Where they should be placed&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="39">The hands should be placed on the chest only; there is no difference between men and women in this regard. I say: placing them anywhere other than on the chest is da’if (weak) or has no basis.</li>
	<li value="40">It is not permissible to put the right hand on the waist.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li>Humility and looking at the place of prostration&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="41">The worshipper must be humble in his prayer, and should avoid everything that may distract him from it, such as adornments and decorations. He should not pray where there is food that he wants to eat, or when he needs to urinate or defecate.</li>
	<li value="42">Whilst he is standing, he should look towards the place where he will prostrate.</li>
	<li value="43">He should not look to the right or the left, because looking here and there is a snatching away which the Shaytan steals from the prayer of the slave.</li>
	<li value="44">It is not permissible for him to look up at the sky.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Du`a al-Istiftah (du`a at the start of prayer)&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="45">Then he should start the prayer with some of the <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/242032/the-opening-supplication-dua-al-istiftah-and-the-versions-narrated-in-hadiths.html" target="_blank">du`as which are narrated from the Prophet</a> (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There are many of these, the most famous of which is “Subhanaka Allahumma wa bihamdika, wa tabaraka ismuka wa ta'ala jadduka, wa la ilaha ghayruka (Glory and praise be to You O Allah, blessed be Your name and exalted be Your Majesty, and there is no god but You).” The command to do this is proven so we should adhere to it. Whoever wants to see the other du`as may refer to Sifat al-Salah, p. 91-95, Maktabat al-Ma’arif, Riyadh, edition. [In English, see “The Prophet’s Prayer described” by Shaykh al-Albani, al-Hanif Publications, p. 14-19]&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Recitation of Quran&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="46">Then he should seek refuge with Allah – this is obligatory, and he is sinning if he omits to do so.</li>
	<li value="47">The Sunnah is sometimes to say “A’udhu Billahi min al-Shaytan ir-rajim, min hamzihi wa nafkhihi wa nafathihi (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan, from his madness, his arrogance and his poetry),” – poetry here refers to blameworthy kinds of poetry.</li>
	<li value="48">And sometimes he may say, “A’udhu Billah is-Sami’ il-A’lieem min al-Shaytan… (I seek refuge with Allah, the All-Hearing, All-Knowing, from the Shaytan…).”</li>
	<li value="49">Then he should say silently – whether the prayer is to be recited aloud or silently – “Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim (In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful).”&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Reciting al-Fatihah&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="50">Then he should recite Surat al-Fatihah (the first surah of the Quran) in full, including the Basmalah (Bismillahi ar-Rahman ar-Rahim). This is an essential part of the prayer, without which the prayer is not valid. Those who do not speak Arabic must memorize this surah.</li>
	<li value="51">Those who cannot remember it should say: “Subhan Allah, wa’l-hamdu-Lillah, wa la ilaha ill-Allah, wa Allahu akbar, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no god but Allah, Allah is Most Great, and there is no strength and no power except with Allah).”</li>
	<li value="52">The Sunnah is to recite it one verse at a time, and to pause at the beginning of each ayah. So he should say: “Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim (In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful),” then pause. Then say, “Al-Hamdu Lillahi Rabb il-‘Alamin (All the praises and thanks be to Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists), then pause. Then say: ‘al-Rahman ar-Rahim (The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful), then pause… and so on, until the end of the surah.</li>
</ol>

<p dir="ltr">This is how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite the whole surah, pausing at the end of each ayah and not joining one ayah to the next, even if there is continuity of the meaning.</p>

<ol dir="ltr">

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li>How the one who is praying behind the imam should recite it&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="54">The one who is praying behind the imam should recite it behind the imam in prayers where Quran in recited silently and in prayers where it is recited aloud, if he cannot hear the imam’s recitation, or if he pauses after completing it so that those who are praying behind him can recite it. We think that this pause was not proven in the Sunnah. I say I have mentioned the evidence of those who think that this pause is permissible and the refutation of that evidence, in Silsilat al-Ahadith al-Da’ifah, no. 546, 547, part 2, p. 24-26, Dar al-Ma’arif edition.&nbsp;</li>

See Sifat al-Salah, p. 135/The Prophet’s prayer described, p. 47). This is obligatory for every person who is praying, even if he is following an imam, because this is the dhikr of standing after ruku`, and saying “Sami’a Allahu liman hamidah” is the dhikr of straightening up from ruku`. It is not prescribed to put the hands one over the other during this standing, because this was not narrated (from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)). For more details, see Sifat Salat al-Nabi, 1 – Istiqbal al-Qiblah (The Prophet’s Prayer Described – Facing the Ka`bah).</li>

	<li value="174">It is obligatory for him in this Tashahhud to <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/69944/the-meaning-of-blessings-and-salaams-upon-the-prophet-peace-and-blessings-of-allah-be-upon-him.html" target="_blank">send prayers upon the Prophet</a> (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), some versions of which we have quoted above when discussing the first Tashahhud.</li>
	<li value="175">He should also seek refuge with Allah from four things and say: “Allahumma inni a’udhu bika min ‘adhab Jahannam wa min ‘adhab al-qabri wa min fitnat il-mahya wa’l-mamat, wa min sharri fitnat il-masih al-dajjal (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the torment of Hell, from the torment of the grave, from the trials of life and death and from the evil of the tribulation of the Dajjal).”</li>
</ol>

<p dir="ltr">The trials of life means the temptations of this world and its desires which a person faces in his life. The trials of death means the torment of the grave and the questioning of the two angels. The tribulation of the Dajjal means the extraordinary feats that will be done at his hands, by which means people will be led astray, and they will follow him and believe his claim to be divine.&nbsp;</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong><a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/5236/what-dua-to-say-after-tashahhud.html" target="_blank">Du`a before the salam&nbsp;</a></strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="176">Then he may pray for himself as he sees fit, as narrated in the Quran and Sunnah. There are many such good du`as. If he does not know any such du`as then he can say whatever is easy for him, for things that will benefit him in his religion and in his worldly affairs.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Various kinds of taslim (saying salams)&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li value="177">Then he should say salams to his right, which is an essential part of the prayer, turning his face so that the whiteness of his right cheek may be seen (from behind).</li>
	<li value="178">Then he should say salams to his left, turning his face so that the whiteness of his left cheek may be seen, even in the funeral prayer</li>
	<li value="179">The imam should raise his voice when saying salam, except in the funeral prayer.</li>
	<li value="180">The salam takes various forms:</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>“Al-Salamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakatuhu” to the right, and “Al-salamu ‘alaaykum wa rahmat-Allah” to the left.</li>
	<li>The same, but without saying “wa barakatuhu”.</li>
	<li>“Al-Salamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allahu” to the right, and “Al-salamu ‘alaykum” to the left.</li>
	<li>Saying one salam, tilting the head slightly to the right.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">O my Muslim brother, this is what I was able to summarize from Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [The Prophet’s Prayer Described], in an attempt to make it more accessible to you, so that it would be clear to you, as if you could see it with your own eyes. If you pray in the manner described to you of how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), prayed, then I hope that Allah will accept that from you, because by doing that you will have truly put into practice the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Pray as you have seen me pray.”&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Moreover you must not forget the importance of presence of mind and humility in prayer, for this is the ultimate purpose of standing before Allah in prayer. The more you can develop the attitude of humility and submission in prayer as described to you in the prayer of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the more benefits you will reap, as indicated by our Lord when He said (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Verily, As-Salat (the prayer) prevents from Al-Fahsha (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed).” [Al-‘Ankabut 29:45]&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Finally, I ask Allah to accept our prayer and all our good deeds, and to store up their reward until the Day when we meet Him:&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">“The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail, Except him who brings to Allah a clean heart [clean from Shirk (polytheism) and Nifaq (hypocrisy)].” [Al-Shu’ara 26:88 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">And Allah knows best.</p>    </section>
