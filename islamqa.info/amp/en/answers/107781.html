        Answer    </h2>

    <section class="content-container">
      <p>Praise be to Allah.</p><p>Paradise is 
	the abode of honour that Allah, may He be exalted, has prepared for His 
	believing slaves. In it are delight and happiness such as have never entered 
	the mind of man and no one has ever imagined. Whoever enters it will find 
	true, eternal happiness and will have attained a great victory. Allah, may 
	He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
	<p>“No 
	person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they 
	used to do”</p>
	<p>
	[as-Sajdah 32:17].&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Part of the 
	happiness that Allah has guaranteed to His believing slaves is that He will 
	reunite the family, parents and children, after they all enter Paradise by 
	the mercy of Allah and the intercession of Prophet Muhammad (blessings and 
	peace of Allah be upon him). This promise is mentioned in the holy Book of 
	Allah, in the verses that will be recited until the Day of Resurrection, in 
	which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
	<p>“And 
	those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, to them shall We 
	join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in 
	anything”</p>
	<p>[at-Toor 
	52:21].&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Ibn ‘Abbaas 
	said, commenting on this verse:&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Allah will 
	raise the offspring of the believer to the same degree as him, even if they 
	are lower than him in terms of good deeds, so as to bring joy to his heart. 
	Then he recited the words (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
	<p>“And 
	those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, to them shall We 
	join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in 
	anything”</p>
	<p>[at-Toor 
	52:21].&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Narrated by 
	Ibn Abi Haatim in at-Tafseer, and by Ibn Abi’d-Dunya in al-‘Iyaal 
	(no. 357), and by others. For more information see: Tafseer Ibn Jareer 
	at-Tabari, 22/467&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This promise 
	is confirmed by what Allah says elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
	<p>“Adn 
	(Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens), which they shall enter and (also) 
	those who acted righteously from among their fathers, and their wives, and 
	their offspring”</p>
	<p>[ar-Ra ‘d 
	13:23]</p>
	<p>“Enter 
	Paradise, you and your wives, in happiness”</p>
	<p>[az-Zukhruf 
	43:70].&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Al-Haafiz 
	Ibn Katheer said in Tasfseer al-Qur’aan al-‘Azeem (4/451):&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The words of 
	Allah, “and (also) those who acted righteously from among their fathers, 
	and their wives, and their offspring” mean: they and their loved ones 
	among their fathers, wives and offspring, of those who were believers and 
	qualified to enter Paradise, will be reunited so as to bring joy to their 
	hearts. And they will be raised from a lower degree to a higher degree 
	without that detracting from the higher degree; rather that is a blessing 
	and favour from Allah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
	<p>“And 
	those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, to them shall We 
	join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in 
	anything. Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned”</p>
	<p>[at-Toor 
	52:21].</p>
	<p>End quote.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>It says in
	Fataawa al-Lajnah ad-Daa’imah (vol. 2, p. 409):&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Question: 
	Will we meet our children in the Hereafter, as all of us are hoping for 
	that? We hope that you will explain this matter for us and tell us of 
	everything that you think is good. May Allah reward you with the best of 
	rewards.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The response 
	was:&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Allah, may 
	He be glorified and exalted, has told us that by His grace, blessing and 
	kindness He will&nbsp; make the offspring of the believers join their fathers in 
	the same status, even if they did not reach the same status in good deeds. 
	Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the 
	meaning):</p>
	<p>“And 
	those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, to them shall We 
	join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in 
	anything. Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned”</p>
	<p>[at-Toor 
	52:21].&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Shaykh Ibn 
	‘Uthaymeen said in Fataawa Noor ‘ala ad-Darb (Aqeedah (belief)/ 
	Belief in the Last Day):&nbsp;</p>
	<p>When a 
	person enters Paradise, will he recognise his relatives? Yes, he will 
	recognise his relatives and others, which will bring joy to his heart, 
	because Allah, may He be exalted, says: </p>
	<p>“(there 
	will be) therein all that the ones inner-selves could desire, all that the 
	eyes could delight in, and you will abide therein forever”</p>
	<p>[az-Zukhruf 
	43:71].</p>
	<p>Indeed a 
	person will be gathered with his offspring in one status even if his 
	offspring are of lower status than him, as Allah says (interpretation of the 
	meaning):</p>
	<p>“And 
	those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, to them shall We 
	join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in 
	anything. Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned”</p>
	<p>[at-Toor 
	52:21].</p>
	<p>End quote.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Secondly:&nbsp;</p>
	<p>We should 
	differentiate between two things here:&nbsp;</p>
	<p>-1-</p>
	<p>The people 
	of Paradise will visit one another, recognise one another and meet one 
	another in the Gardens of delights. This is part of the perfect delight of 
	the people of Paradise. There is nothing to prevent someone of a lower 
	status in Paradise from visiting one who is above him, as also happens in 
	this world.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Allah, may 
	He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
	<p>“Then 
	they will turn to one another, mutually questioning.</p>
	<p>A speaker 
	of them will say: ‘Verily, I had a companion (in the world),</p>
	<p>Who used 
	to say: ‘Are you among those who believe (in resurrection after death)<a name="#53">?
	</a></p>
	<p>‘(That) 
	when we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed (be raised up) to 
	receive reward or punishment (according to our deeds)?<a name="#54">’</a></p>
	<p>(The man) 
	said: ‘Will you look down?<a name="#55">’</a></p>
	<p>So he 
	looked down and saw him in the midst of the Fire.</p>
	<p>He said: 
	‘By Allah! You have nearly ruined me.</p>
	<p>‘Had it 
	not been for the Grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those 
	brought forth (to Hell).<a name="#58">’</a></p>
	<p>(Allah 
	informs about that true believer that he said): ‘Are we then not to die (any 
	more)?</p>
	<p>‘Except 
	our first death, and we shall not be punished? (after we have entered 
	Paradise).<a name="#60">’</a></p>
	<p>Truly, 
	this is the supreme success!</p>
	<p>For the 
	like of this let the workers work”</p>
	<p>[as-Saaffaat 
	:50-61].&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Ibn Katheer 
	(may Allah have mercy on him) said:&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Here, Allah, 
	may He be exalted, tells us about the people of Paradise: they will turn to 
	one another and ask one another about their situation, how they were in the 
	world and what they used to suffer there? This is an example of their 
	meeting and conversing over their drinks, whilst they are sitting on 
	thrones, with servants around them, coming and going with delights such as 
	food, drink, clothing and other things that no eye has seen, no ear has 
	heard, nor has it entered the mind of man.</p>
	<p>End quote 
	from Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 7/15. See also Haadi al-Arwaah by 
	Ibn al-Qayyim, 1/259-263&nbsp;</p>
	<p>With regard 
	to fathers and sons, or other family members, being gathered in the same 
	level of Paradise on an eternal basis, what appears to be the case – and 
	Allah knows best – is that this applies only to those who die in childhood 
	and their parents; Allah will bless their parents in Paradise and raise the 
	children to their status, so that they may have the joy of being with their 
	children there.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Ibn 
	al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after speaking of the 
	difference of opinion concerning this matter:&nbsp;</p>
	<p>It seems 
	most likely that only those children who died in childhood are singled out 
	in this case. No one of a lower degree could join someone of a higher 
	degree, and the fact that children will join their parents is something 
	natural, because a man usually has his children with him. And Allah knows 
	best.</p>
	<p>End quote 
	from Haadi al-Arwaah, 398&nbsp;</p>
	<p>This is also 
	the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on 
	him). See al-Baab al-Maftooh, 4/161&nbsp;</p>

	answer to question no. <a href="../../../en/answers/5981/will-a-woman-be-with-her-husband-in-paradise.html" class="LinkFatwa">5981</a> and
