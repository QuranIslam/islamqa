    <section class="content-container">
      <p>Praise be to Allah.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="why-islam-is-the-true-religion"><strong>Why Islam is the true religion</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">This is a reasonable enough question for one who has not entered <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/49023/what-are-the-degrees-of-islam.html" target="_blank">Islam</a> , but one who believes in and practices this religion already knows the blessings which are his because of this religion. There are many reasons for this, which include the following:</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>The Muslim worships One God, Who has no partner, and Who has the most beautiful names and the highest attributes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">Thus the Muslim’s focus and aim is concentrated, focused on His Lord and Creator; he puts his trust in Him and asks Him for help, patience and support; he believes that Allah is able to do all things, and has no need of a wife or son.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Allah created the heavens and earth; He is the One Who gives life and death; He is the Creator and Sustainer from Whom the slave seeks provision. He is the All-Hearing Who responds to the supplication of His slave, and from Whom the slave hopes for a response. He is the All-Merciful and All-Forgiving, to Whom the slave turns in repentance when he has committed a sin or fallen short in his worship of Allah. He is the Omniscient and All-Seeing, Who knows all intentions and what is hidden in people’s hearts.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The slave feels ashamed to commit a sin by doing wrong to himself or to others, because his Lord is watching over him and sees all that he does. He knows that Allah is All-Wise, the Seer of the Unseen, so he trusts that what Allah decrees for him is good; he knows that Allah will never be unjust to him, and that everything that Allah decrees for him is good, even if he does not understand the wisdom behind it.</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>The effects of Islamic worship on the soul of the Muslim include the following:</li>
</ul>

<ol dir="ltr">
	<li><a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/12305/importance-of-prayer.html" target="_blank">Prayer</a> keeps the slave in contact with his Lord; if he enters it in a spirit of humility and concentration, he will feel tranquil and secure, because he is seeking a "powerful support," which is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. For this reason, the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: "Let us find relaxation and joy in prayer." If something distressed him, he would hasten to pray. Everyone who finds himself faced with disaster and tries prayer finds strength, patience and consolation, because he is reciting the words of his Lord, which cannot be compared to the effect of the words of a created being. If the words of some psychologists can offer a little comfort, what do you think of the words of the One Who created the psychologist?</li>
</ol>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>Now let us look at <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/43609/what-is-the-wisdom-of-zakah.html" target="_blank">Zakah</a> (the poor due), which is one of the <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/13569/what-are-the-pillars-of-islam.html" target="_blank">pillars of Islam</a> . Zakah purifies the soul from stinginess and miserliness, and accustoms people to being generous and helping the poor and needy. It will bring a great reward on the Day of Resurrection, just like other forms of worship. It is not burdensome, like man-made taxes; it is only 25 in every thousand, which the sincere Muslim pays willingly and does not try to evade or wait until someone chases him for it.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/38064/why-do-muslims-fast.html" target="_blank">Fasting</a> involves refraining from food and sex for an appointed time. It is a form of worship, and a way in which one can feel the hunger of those who are deprived. It is also a reminder of the blessings of the Creator, and it brings rewards beyond measure.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/109234/benefits-of-hajj.html" target="_blank">Hajj</a> is the Pilgrimage to the sacred House of Allah, which was built by Ibrahim (Abraham, upon whom be peace). By performing Hajj one is obeying the command of Allah and the call to come and meet Muslims from all over the world.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/11403/enjoining-what-is-good-and-forbidding-what-is-evil.html" target="_blank">Islam commands all kinds of good and forbids all kinds of evil</a> . It encourages good manners and proper treatment of others.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3 dir="ltr" id="what-are-the-good-characteristics-in-islam"><strong>What are the good characteristics in Islam?</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">Islam enjoins <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/101023/how-to-acquire-good-characteristics-in-islam.html" target="_blank">good characteristics</a> such as truthfulness, patience, deliberation, kindness, humility, modesty, keeping promises, dignity, mercy, justice, courage, patience, friendliness, contentment, chastity, good treatment, tolerance, trustworthiness, gratitude for favours, and self-control in times of anger. Islam commands the Muslim to fulfil his duty towards his parents and to uphold family ties, to help the needy, to treat neighbours well, to protect and safeguard the wealth of the orphan, to be gentle with the young and show respect to the old, to be kind to servants and animals, to remove harmful things from the road, to speak kind words, to forgive at the time when one has the opportunity to take revenge, to be sincere towards one’s fellow-Muslims, to meet the needs of the Muslims, to give the debtor time to repay his debt, to prefer others over oneself, to console others, to greet people with a smiling face, to visit the sick, to support the one who is oppressed, to give gifts to friends, to honour his guest, to treat his wife kindly and spend on her and her children, to spread the greeting of peace (salam) and to seek permission before entering another person’s house, lest one see something private that the other person does not want one to see.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Some non-Muslims may do these things out of politeness or good manners, but they are not seeking reward from Allah or salvation of the Day of Judgement.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr" id="what-is-forbidden-in-islam"><strong>What is forbidden in Islam?</strong></h3>

<p dir="ltr">If we look at what Islam has prohibited, we will find that it is in the interests of both the individual and society as a whole. All these prohibitions serve to safeguard the relationship between the slave and his Lord, and the relationship of the individual with himself and with his fellow-man.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The following examples demonstrate this:</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/34817/what-is-shirk-and-its-types.html" target="_blank">Islam forbids the association of anything in worship with Allah</a> and the worship of anything other than Allah, because this spells doom and misery.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/8291/ruling-on-going-to-astrologers-and-believing-them.html" target="_blank">Islam also forbids visiting or believing soothsayers</a> and fortune-tellers; magic or witchcraft that may cause a rift between two people or bring them together; belief in the influence of the stars on events and people’s lives; cursing time, because Allah is directing its affairs; and superstition, because this is pessimism.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>Islam forbids cancelling out good deeds by <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/9359/showing-off-riya-in-worship.html" target="_blank">showing off</a> , boasting or reminding others of one’s favours; bowing or prostrating to anything other than Allah; sitting with hypocrites or immoral people for the purposes of enjoying their company or keeping them company; and invoking the curse or wrath of Allah on one another or damning one another to Hell.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>Islam forbids urinating into stagnant water; defecating on the side of the road or in places where people seek shade or where they draw water; from facing the qiblah (direction of prayer) or turning one’s back towards it when passing water or stool giving the greeting of salam (peace) to one who is answering the call of nature; and putting one’s hand into any vessel before washing it, when one has just woken up.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>Islam forbids the offering of any nafl (supererogatory) prayers when the sun is rising, when it is at its zenith, and when it is setting, because it rises and sets between the horns of Shaytan (Satan); praying when there is food prepared that a person desires; praying when one urgently needs to pass water, stool or wind, because that will distract a person from concentrating properly on his prayer.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>Islam forbids the Muslim to raise his voice in prayer, lest it disturb other believers; to continue offering supererogatory prayers at night when one feels drowsy - such a person should sleep then get up; to stay up all night in prayer, especially one night after another; and to stop praying when there is doubt as to the validity of one’s wudu - unless one hears a sound or smells an odour.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>Islam forbids buying, selling and making "lost and found" announcements in the mosque - because it is the place of worship and remembrance of Allah, where worldly affairs have no place.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>Islam forbids haste in walking when the iqamah (call immediately preceding congregational prayer) is given, and prescribes walking in a calm and dignified manner.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>It is also forbidden to boast about the cost of building a mosque; to decorate a mosque with red or yellow paint or adornments which will distract the worshippers; to fast day after day without a break.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>Islam forbids building over graves, making them high, sitting on them, walking between them wearing shoes, putting lights over them or writing on them.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>It is forbidden to disinter the dead or to take graves as places of worship.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>Islam forbids wailing, tearing one’s clothes or leaving one’s hair unkempt when a person dies.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>Eulogizing the dead in the manner of the times of Ignorance (Jahiliyyah) is also forbidden, although there is nothing wrong with informing others that a person has died.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>Islam forbids the <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/22339/riba-in-islam-permissible.html" target="_blank">consumption of riba</a> (interest); all kinds of selling which involve ignorance (of the product), misleading and cheating; selling blood, wine, pork, idols and everything that Allah has forbidden - their price, whether bought or sold - is haram (unlawful); najash, which is offering a price for something one has no intention of buying, as happens in many auctions; concealing a product’s faults at the time of selling; selling something which one does not own or before it comes into one’s possession; undercutting, outbidding or out bargaining another; selling produce before it is clear that it is in good condition and free of blemish; cheating in weights and measures; and hoarding.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>A partner who has shares in a plot of land or a date palm tree is forbidden to sell his share without consulting his partners.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>It is forbidden to consume the wealth of orphans unjustly; to bet or gamble; to take anything by force; to accept or offer bribes; to steal people’s wealth or to consume it unjustly; to take something for the purpose of destroying it; to undermine the value of people’s possessions; to keep lost property which one has found, or to keep quiet about it and not announce it, for it belongs to the one who recognizes it; to cheat in any way; to ask for a loan with no intention of repaying it; to take anything of the wealth of a fellow-Muslim, unless it is given freely, because what is taken because of another person’s shyness is haram (impermissible); and to accept a gift because of intercession.</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/126987/the-ruling-on-castration.html" target="_blank">Celibacy and castration</a> are forbidden, as is marrying two sisters, or a woman and her aunt (paternal or maternal), whether he marries the aunt after marrying her niece or vice versa, for fear of breaking the ties of kinship.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>It is forbidden to make deals in marriage, such as saying "Let me marry your daughter and I will give you my daughter or sister in marriage." Such reciprocal deals are a form of oppression and injustice, and haram.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">

</ul>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li>It is forbidden to wish (a newly married couple) "Bi’l-rafa wa’l-ban<span dir="RTL">ه</span>n (a joyful life and many sons)," because this is the greeting of the people of Jahiliyyah (ignorance), who hated daughters.&nbsp;</li>
