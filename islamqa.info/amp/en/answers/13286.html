    <section class="content-container">
      <p>Praise be to Allah.</p><h3 id="how-was-adam-created">How was Adam created?</h3>

<p>Allah created Adam with His Hand and breathed into him his soul created by Him, and told His angels to prostrate to him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Allah created Adam from dust, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Verily, the likeness of ‘Isa (Jesus) before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: ‘Be!’ — and he was.” [Al ‘Imran 3:59]&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Allah had completed the creation of Adam, <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/8492/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-angels-prostrating-to-adam-and-yoosufs-brothers-prostrating-to-him.html" target="_blank">He commanded the angels to prostrate to him</a> , so they prostrated, except for Iblis, who was present but he refused and was too arrogant to prostrate to Adam:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“(Remember) when your Lord said to the angels: ‘Truly, I am going to create man from clay. So when I have fashioned him and breathed into him (his) soul created by Me, then you fall down prostrate to him.’ So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them, except Iblis (Satan), he was proud and was one of the disbelievers.” [Sad 38:71-74 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then Allah told the angels that He was going to <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/72470/life-on-earth-before-adam.html" target="_blank">place Adam on earth</a> and make generations after generations of his offspring, as He said (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>

<p>“And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: ‘Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth’.” [al-Baqarah 2:30]&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="allah-taught-adam-all-the-names">Allah taught Adam all the names&nbsp;</h3>

<p>“And He taught Adam all the names (of everything).”&nbsp; [al-Baqarah 2:31 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Iblis refused to prostrate to Adam, Allah expelled him and cursed him:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“(Allah) said: ‘Then get out from here; for verily, you are outcast.&nbsp; And verily, My Curse is on you till the Day of Recompense’” [Sad 38:77-78 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Iblis knew of his fate, he asked Allah to give him respite until the Day of Resurrection:</p>

<p>“[Iblis (Satan)] said: ‘My Lord! Give me then respite till the Day the (dead) are resurrected.’</p>

<p>(Allah) said: ‘Verily, you are of those allowed respite till the Day of the time appointed’.” [Sad 38:79-81 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Allah granted him that, he declared war on Adam and his descendants, made disobedience attractive to them and tempted them to commit immoral actions:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“[Iblis (Satan)] said: ‘By Your Might, then I will surely, mislead them all, Except Your chosen slaves amongst them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).’” [Sad 38:82-83 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="how-was-eve-created">How was Eve created?</h3>

<p><a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/20652/commentary-on-the-hadeeth-allaah-created-adam-in-his-image.html" target="_blank">Allah created Adam</a> , and from him He created his wife, and from their progeny He created men and women, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>

<p>“O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam) He created his wife [Hawwa (Eve)], and from them both He created many men and women.” [al-Nisa 4:1]&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then Allah caused Adam and his wife to dwell in Paradise, as a test for them. He commanded them to eat of the fruits of Paradise but He forbade them to eat from one tree:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“And We said: ‘O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimun (wrong-doers)’” [al-Baqarah 2:35 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>Allah warned Adam and his wife against the Shaytan, as He said (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>

<p>“O Adam! Verily, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. So let him not get you both out of Paradise, so that you will be distressed” [Ta-Ha 20:117]&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then the Shaytan whispered to Adam and his wife, and tempted them to eat from the forbidden tree. Adam forgot and could not resist the temptation, so he disobeyed his Lord and ate from that tree:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Then Shaytan (Satan) whispered to him, saying : ‘O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away?’ Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts became manifest to them, and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Paradise for their covering. Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray” [Ta-Ha 20:120-121 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>Their Lord called to them and said (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you: Verily, Shaytan (Satan) is an open enemy unto you?” [al-A’raf 7:22]&nbsp;</p>

<p>When they ate from the tree, they regretted what they had done, and said:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers” [al-A’raf 7:23 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="what-was-adam-s-sin">What was Adam’s sin?</h3>

<p>The sin of Adam stemmed from desire, not from arrogance, hence Allah guided him to repent and He accepted that from him:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful” [al-Baqarah 2:37 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the way for Adam and his descendents: whoever sins then repents sincerely, Allah will accept his repentance:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do” [al-Shura 42:25 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="why-did-allah-send-adam-to-earth">Why did Allah send Adam to earth?</h3>

<p>Then Allah sent Adam and his wife, and Iblis, down to the earth, and He sent down Revelation to them and He sent the messengers to them.&nbsp; So whoever believes will enter Paradise and whoever disbelieves will enter Hell:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We said: ‘Get down all of you from this place (the Paradise), then whenever there comes to you Guidance from Me, and whoever follows My Guidance, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.</p>

<p>But those who disbelieve and belie Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) — such are the dwellers of the Fire. They shall abide therein forever’” [al-Baqarah 2:38-39 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Allah sent them all down to the earth, the conflict between faith and disbelief, between truth and falsehood, between good and evil, began, and it will continue until Allah inherits the earth and everyone on it:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“(Allah) said: ‘Get down, one of you an enemy to the other [i.e. Adam, Hawwa, (Eve), and Shaytan (Satan)]. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time.’ [al-A’raf 7:24 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>Allah is Able to do all things. <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/21949/meaning-of-the-hadeeth-which-says-that-allaah-created-adam-in-his-image.html" target="_blank">He created Adam</a> with no father or mother, and He created Hawwa from a father with no mother, and <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/6333/how-was-eesaa-peace-be-upon-him-created.html" target="_blank">He created ‘Isa from a mother with no father</a> , and He created us from a father and a mother.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Allah created Adam from dust, then He made his descendants from semen of despised water, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Who made everything He has created good and He began the creation of man from clay.</p>

<p>Then He made his offspring from semen of despised water (male and female sexual discharge).</p>

<p>Then He fashioned him in due proportion, and breathed into him the soul (created by Allah for that person); and He gave you hearing (ears), sight (eyes) and hearts. Little is the thanks you give!” [al-Sajdah 32:7-9]&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="creation-of-man-in-islam">Creation of man in Islam</h3>

<p>How man is created in the womb, and the stages which he goes through, is a wondrous thing. Allah mentioned this in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):&nbsp;</p>

<p>“And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth).</p>

<p>Thereafter, We made him (the offspring of Adam) as a Nutfah (mixed drops of the male and female sexual discharge and lodged it) in a safe lodging (womb of the woman).</p>

<p>Then We made the Nutfah into a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood), then We made the clot into a little lump of flesh, then We made out of that little lump of flesh bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, and then We brought it forth as another creation. So Blessed is Allah, the Best of creators.” [al-Muminun 23:12-14]&nbsp;</p>

<p>Allah Alone creates whatever He wills. He knows what is in the wombs, and He decrees provision and lifespans (for His creatures):&nbsp;</p>

<p>“To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows female (offspring) upon whom He wills, and bestows male (offspring) upon whom He wills.</p>

<p>Or He bestows both males and females, and He renders barren whom He wills. Verily, He is the All-Knower and is Able to do all things” [al-Shura 42:49-50 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has appointed an angel over the womb. He says, ‘O Lord, a drop of semen (nutfah); O Lord, a clot (‘alaqah); O Lord, a little lump of flesh (mudghah).’ Then if Allah wishes (to complete) its creation, the angel asks, (O Lord) male or female, wretched (doomed to Hell) or blessed (destined for Paradise)? How much will his provision be? And what will his lifespan be?’ So that is written whilst (the child) is still in the mother's womb.”&nbsp;(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 318)&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="honoring-the-children-of-adam">Honoring the children of Adam</h3>

<p>Allah honoured the children of Adam and subjugated for their benefit that which is in the heavens and on earth:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“See you not (O men) that Allah has subjected for you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and has completed and perfected His Graces upon you, (both) apparent (i.e. Islamic Monotheism, and the lawful pleasures of this world, including health, good looks) and hidden [i.e. one’s faith in Allah (of Islamic Monotheism), knowledge, wisdom, guidance for doing righteous deeds, and also the pleasures and delights of the Hereafter in Paradise]? [Luqman 31:20 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>Allah has distinguished and honoured man with reason by which he knows his Lord, Creator and Provider, and by which he knows what is good and evil, what will benefit him and what will harm him, what is halal and what is haram.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Allah did not create man and leave him alone with no path to follow. Rather, Allah revealed the Books and sent messengers to guide mankind to the Straight Path.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Allah created people with a natural inclination towards monotheism (Tawhid – belief in the Oneness of Allah). Every time they deviated from that, Allah sent a prophet to bring them back to the Straight Path. The first of the prophets was Adam and the last was Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them):&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Mankind were one community and Allah sent Prophets with glad tidings and warnings, and with them He sent down the Scripture in truth to judge between people in matters wherein they differed.” [al-Baqarah 2:213 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>All the messengers called people to the same truth, which is the worship of Allah Alone and to reject all gods besides Him:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a messenger (proclaiming): “Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghut (all false deities, i.e. do not worship Taghut besides Allah).” [al-Nahl 16:36 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="the-religion-with-allah-is-islam">The religion with Allah is Islam</h3>

<p>The religion with which Allah sent the Prophets and Messengers was the same, i.e., Islam:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam” [Al ‘Imran 3:19 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last of the heavenly Books which Allah revealed was the Quran, confirming the Books which came before it, and as a guidance to all of mankind:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“(This is) a Book which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad) in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness (of disbelief and polytheism) into light.” [Ibrahim 14:1 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last of the prophets and messengers whom Allah sent was Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last (end) of the prophets” [al-Ahzab 33:40 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<p>Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to all of mankind:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah’” [al-A’raf 7:158 – interpretation of the meaning]&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="quran-is-the-last-revelation">Quran is the last revelation</h3>

<p>The <a class="LinkFatwa" href="../../../en/answers/180883/revelation-of-the-quran-all-at-once-or-gradually.html" target="_blank">Quran is the last and greatest of the heavenly Books</a> and Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the last and best of the prophets and messengers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Allah has abrogated all of the heavenly Books with the Quran, so whoever does not follow the Quran and enter Islam and believe in the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and follow him, his deeds will not be accepted:&nbsp;</p>

<p>“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers” [Al ‘Imran 3:85 – interpretation of the meaning]</p>

<h3 id="all-prophets-came-with-the-same-message">All prophets came with the same message</h3>

<p>The religion which was brought by Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) confirms the message brought by the prophets before him, in its basic principles and advocation of noble characteristics, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>

<p>&nbsp;“He (Allah) has ordained for you the same religion (Islamic Monotheism) which He ordained for Nuh (Noah), and that which We have revealed to you (O Muhammad), and that which We ordained for Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and ‘Isa (Jesus) saying you should establish religion (i.e. to do what it orders you to do practically) and make no divisions] in it (religion) (i.e. various sects in religion).” [al-Shura 42:13]&nbsp;</p>

<p>And Allah knows best.</p>    </section>
