        Answer    </h2>

    <section class="content-container">
      <p>Praise be to Allah.</p><p>We thank you for your question, and would like to answer by quoting a number of aayaat (verses) from the Book of Allaah (the Qur’aan – the scripture of Islam), then you can think to yourself about the matter and if the truth becomes clear to you, you will have no choice but to follow it.</p>

<p>Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>

<p>“Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators?</p>

<p>Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they have no firm Belief.</p>

<p>Or are with them the treasures of your Lord? Or are they the tyrants with the authority to do as they like?”[al-Toor 52:35-37]</p>

<p>“Verily, the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and the ships which sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind, and the water (rain) which Allaah sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death, and the moving (living) creatures of all kinds that He has scattered therein, and in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth, are indeed aayaat (proofs, evidences, signs) for people of understanding.”[al-Baqarah 2:164]</p>

<p>“It is He Who sends down water (rain) from the sky, and with it We bring forth vegetation of all kinds, and out of it We bring forth green stalks, from which We bring forth thick clustered grain. And out of the date-palm and its spathe come forth clusters of dates hanging low and near, and gardens of grapes, olives and pomegranates, each similar (in kind) yet different (in variety and taste). Look at their fruits when they begin to bear, and the ripeness thereof. Verily! In these things there are signs for people who believe.”[al-An’aam 6:99]</p>

<p>“And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy (rain), till when they have carried a heavy-laden cloud, We drive it to a land that is dead, then We cause water (rain) to descend thereon. Then We produce every kind of fruit therewith. Similarly, We shall raise up the dead, so that you may remember or take heed.”[al-A’raaf 7:57]</p>

<p>“Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one united piece, then We parted them? And We have made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?”[al-Anbiya’ 21:30]</p>

<p>“Is not He (better than your gods) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water (rain) from the sky, whereby We cause to grow wonderful gardens full of beauty and delight? It is not in your ability to cause the growth of their trees. Is there any god with Allaah? Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals (to Him)!”[al-Naml 27:60]</p>

<p>“He has created the heavens and the earth without any pillars that you see, and has set on the earth firm mountains, lest it should shake with you. And He has scattered therein moving (living) creatures of all kinds. And We send down water (rain) from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind to grow therein.”[Luqmaan 31:10]</p>

<p>“See you not (O men) that Allaah has subjected for you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and has completed and perfected His Graces upon you, (both) apparent (i.e., Islamic Monotheism, and the lawful pleasures of this world, including health, good looks, etc.) and hidden (i.e., one’s Faith in Allaah, knowledge, wisdom, guidance for doing righteous deeds, and also the pleasures and delights of the Hereafter in Paradise, etc.)? Yet of mankind in he who disputes about Allaah without knowledge or guidance or a Book giving light!”[Luqmaan 31:20]</p>

<p>“And the two seas (kinds of water) are not alike, this fresh, sweet and pleasant to drink, and that saltish and bitter. And from them both you eat fresh tender meat (fish), and derive the ornaments that you wear. And you see the ships cleaving (the sea-water as they sail through it), that you may seek of His Bounty, and that you may give thanks.”[Faatir 35:12]</p>

<p>“Have you not seen how your Lord spread the shadow? If He willed, He could have made it still – then We have made the sun its guide [i.e., after the sunrise, it (the shadow) contracts and vanishes at noon, and then again appears in the afternoon with the decline of the sun, and had there been no sunlight, there would have been no shadow]</p>

<p>Then We withdraw it to Us – a gradual concealed withdrawal.</p>

<p>And it is He Who makes the night a covering for you, and the sleep (as) repose, and makes the day nushoor (i.e., getting up and going about here and there for daily work, etc., after one’s sleep at night or like resurrection after one’s death).</p>

<p>And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy (rain), and We send down pure water from the sky, -</p>

<p>That We may give life thereby to a dead land, and We give to drink thereof many of the cattle and men that We had created,”</p>

<p>[al-Furqaan 25:45-49]</p>

<p>“And it is He Who has let free the two seas (kinds of water), one palatable and sweet, and the other salt and bitter, and He has set a barrier and a complete partition between them.”</p>

<p>[al-Furqaan 25:53]</p>

<p>“And a sign for them is the dead land. We gave it life, and We brought forth from it grains, so that they eat thereof.</p>

<p>And We have made therein gardens of date-palms and grapes, and We have caused springs of water to gush forth therein.</p>

<p>So that they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands made it not. Will they not, then, give thanks?</p>

<p>Glory be to Him, Who has created all the pairs of that which the earth produces, as well as of their own (human) kind (male and female), and of that which they know not.</p>

<p>And a sing for them is the night. We withdraw therefrom the day, and behold, they are in darkness.</p>

<p>And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term (appointed). That is the Decree of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>

<p>And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse) till it returns like the old dried curved date stalk.</p>

<p>It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day. They all float, each in an orbit.</p>

<p>And a sign for them is that We bore their offspring in the laden ship (of Nooh).</p>

<p>And We have created for them of the like thereunto, so on them they ride.</p>

<p>And if We will, We shall drown them, and there will be no shout (or helper) for them (to hear their cry for help) nor will they be saved,</p>

<p>Unless it be a mercy from Us, and as an enjoyment for a while.”</p>

<p>[Yaa-Seen 36:33-44]</p>

<p>“We created you, then why do you believe not?</p>

<p>Then tell Me (about) the human semen that you emit.</p>

<p>Is it you who create it (i.e., make this semen into a perfect human being), or are We the Creator?</p>

<p>We have decreed death unto you all, and We are not unable,</p>

<p>To transfigure you and create you in (forms) that you know not.</p>

<p>And indeed, you have already known the first form of creation (i.e., the creation of Adam). Why then do you not remember or take heed?</p>

<p>Tell Me! The seed that you sow in the ground.</p>

<p>Is it you that make it grow, or are We the Grower?</p>

<p>Were it Our Will, We could crumble it to dry pieces, and you would be regretful (or left in wonderment),</p>

<p>(Saying), ‘We are indeed Mughramoon (i.e., ruined, or lost the money without any profit, or punished by the loss of all that we spent for cultivation, etc.)!</p>

<p>‘Nay, but we are deprived!’</p>

<p>Tell Me! The water that you drink,</p>

<p>Is it you who cause it from the rainclouds to come down, or are We the Causer of it to come down?</p>

<p>If We willed, We verily could make it salt (and undrinkable). Why then do you not give thanks (to Allaah)?</p>

<p>Tell Me! The fire which you kindle,</p>

<p>Is it you who made the tree thereof to grow, or are We the Grower?</p>

<p>We have made it a Reminder (for the Hell-fire, in the Hereafter); and an article of use for the travellers (and all others, in this world).</p>

<p>The glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great.</p>

<p>So I swear by mawaaqi’ (setting to the mansions, etc.) of the stars (they traverse),</p>

<p>And verily, that is indeed a great oath, if you but knew,</p>

<p>That (this) is indeed an honourable recital (the Noble Qur’aan).”</p>

<p>[al-Waaqi’ah 56:57-77]</p>

<p>“So glorify Allaah, when you come up to the evening [i.e., offer the Maghrib (sunset) and ‘Isha’ (night) prayers], and when you enter the morning [i.e., offer the Fajr (morning) prayers].</p>

<p>And His is all the praise and thanks in the heavens and the earth, and (glorify Him) in the afternoon [i.e., offer ‘Asr (mid-afternoon) prayer] and when you come up to the time when the day begins to decline [i.e., offer the Zuhr (mid-day) prayer].</p>

<p>He brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living. And He revives the earth after its death, and thus shall you be brought out (resurrected).</p>

<p>And among His Signs is this, that He created you (Adam) from dust, and then [Hawwa (Eve) from Adam’s rib, then his offspring from the semen, and], - behold you are human beings scattered!</p>

<p>And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect.</p>

<p>And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of your languages and colours. Verily in that are indeed signs for men of sound knowledge.</p>

<p>And among His Signs is the sleep that you take by night and by day, and your seeking of His Bounty. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who listen.</p>

<p>And among His Signs is that He shows you the lightning, by way of fear and hope, and He sends down water (rain) from the sky, and therewith revives the earth after its death. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who understand.</p>

<p>And among His Signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by His Command, then afterwards when He will call you by single call, behold, you will come out from the earth (i.e, from your graves, for reckoning and recompense).</p>

<p>To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. All are obedient to Him.</p>

<p>And He it is Who originates the creation, then will repeat it (after it has perished), and this is easier for Him. His is the highest description (i.e., none has the right to be worshipped but He, and there is nothing comparable unto Him) in the heavens and in the earth. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”[al-Room 30: 17-27]</p>

<p>“Is not He (better than your gods) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water (rain) from the sky, whereby We cause to grow wonderful gardens full of beauty and delight? It is not in your ability to cause the growth of their trees. Is there any god with Allaah? Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals (to Him)!</p>

<p>Is not he (better than you gods) Who has made the earth as a fixed abode, and has placed rivers in its midst, and has placed firm mountains therein, and has set a barrier between the two seas (of salt and sweet water). Is there any god with Allaah? Nay, but most of them know not.</p>

<p>Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when He calls Him, and Who removes the evil, generations after generations. Is there any god with Allaah? Little is it that you remember!</p>

<p>Is not He (better than your gods) Who guides you in the darkness of the land and the sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain)? Is there any god with Allaah? High Exalted be Allaah above all that they associate as partners (to Him)!</p>

<p>Is not He (better than your so-called gods) Who originates creation, and shall thereafter repeat it, and Who provides for you from heaven and earth? Is there any god with Allaah? Say: ‘bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful’</p>

<p>Say: ‘None on the heavens and the earth knows the unseen except Allaah, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.’”</p>

<p>[al-Naml 27:60-65]</p>

<p>This is a selection of clear aayaat that include the answer to your question. We invite you to join the community of the believers and to enter the religion of Islam which Allaah has chosen as the religion for all mankind. Peace be upon those who follow true Guidance.</p>    </section>
