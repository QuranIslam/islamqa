        Answer    </h2>

    <section class="content-container">
      <p>Praise be to Allah.</p><p>
      
      Firstly:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    
    Democracy is not an Arabic word. Rather it is derived from the Greek, and it 
    is a composite of two words: demos, meaning the masses or the people, 
    and kratia, meaning rule. So what is meant is the rule of the masses 
    or the rule of the people.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    
    Secondly:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    
    Democracy is a system that is contrary to Islam, because it gives the power 
    of legislation to the people or to those who represent them (such as members 
    of Parliament). Based on that, in democracy legislative authority is given 
    to someone other than Allah, may He be exalted; rather it is given to the 
    people and their deputies, and what matters is not their consensus but the 
    majority. Thus what the majority agree upon becomes laws that are binding on 
    the nation, even if it is contrary to common sense, religious teaching or 
    reason. In these systems legislation has been promulgated allowing abortion, 
    same-sex marriage and usurious interest (riba); the rulings of sharee‘ah 
    have been abolished; and fornication/adultery and the drinking of alcohol 
    are permitted. In fact this system is at war with Islam and its followers.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    
    Allah, may He be exalted, has told us in the His Book that legislative 
    authority belongs to Him alone, and that He is the wisest of those who issue 
    rulings and judge. He has forbidden the association of anyone with Him in 
    His authority, and no one is better than Him in ruling.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    
    Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
    <p>
    “So 
    the judgement is only with Allah, the Most High, the Most Great!”</p>
    <p>
    [Ghaafir 
    40:12]</p>
    <p>
    “The 
    command (or the judgement) is for none but Allah. He has commanded that you 
    worship none but Him (i.e. His Monotheism), that is the (true) straight 
    religion, but most men know not”</p>
    <p>
    [Yoosuf 
    12:40]</p>
    <p>
    “Is 
    not Allah the Best of judges?”</p>
    <p>
    
    [at-Teen 95:8]</p>
    <p>
    “Say: 
    ‘Allah knows best how long they stayed. With Him is (the knowledge of) the 
    unseen of the heavens and the earth. How clearly He sees, and hears 
    (everything)! They have no Walee (Helper, Disposer of affairs, Protector, 
    etc.) other than Him, and He makes none to share in His Decision and His 
    Rule’”</p>
    <p>
    [al-Kahf 
    18:26]</p>
    <p>
    “Do 
    they then seek the judgement of (the Days of) Ignorance? And who is better 
    in judgement than Allah for a people who have firm Faith?”</p>
    <p>
    [al-Maa’idah 
    5:50].&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    
    Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the Creator of all things and He 
    knows what is good for them and what is in their best interests of rulings. 
    Human beings vary in intellect, attitude and customs, and they are unaware 
    of what is best for them, let alone what is best for others. Hence in 
    societies that are ruled by the people in terms of legislation and laws, one 
    sees only corruption, immorality and disintegration of the social fabric.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    It 
    should be noted that in many countries this system has changed into 
    something that has no reality behind it, and it is mere slogans by which 
    people are deceived; in fact the real ruler is the head of state and his 
    helpers, and the people are suppressed and have no say in anything.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    There 
    is nothing more indicative of that than the fact that when this democracy 
    produces results that do not suit the desires of the rulers, they crush it 
    underfoot. Cases of election fraud, suppression of freedoms and silencing of 
    the voices of those who speak the truth are well known to everyone and do 
    not need further proof.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    This 
    is very clear in many countries and does not need any proof.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    It 
    says in Mawsoo‘ah al-Adyaan wa’l-Madhaahib al-Mu‘aasirah (2/1066):&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    
    Representative democracy:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    This 
    is one of the democratic systems in which the people exercise authority 
    through a council of elected representatives of the people. In this system 
    the people retain the right to exercise some aspects of authority directly 
    by various means, the most important of which are:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    1.
    
    The right to propose laws, which is done when a number of 
    people propse a law in general terms or in detail, which the parliament will 
    then discuss and vote upon.</p>
    <p>
    2.
    
    The right to a referendum, whereby a law that has already 
    been approved by Parliament is presented to the people so that they can have 
    their say.</p>
    <p>
    3.
    
    The right of objection, whereby a number of voters defined by 
    the Constitution have the right to object to a law within a certain period 
    after it has been passed, which will result in taking the matter to the 
    people for a general referendum; if the people agree with it, it will be 
    promulgated, otherwise it will be annulled. This is included in most modern 
    constitutions.</p>
    <p>
    
    Undoubtedly democratic systems are one of the modern forms of shirk, in 
    terms of obedience and submission, or in legislation, as it disregards the 
    authority of the Creator, may He be glorified and exalted, and His absolute 
    right of legislation, and regards that as one of the rights of created 
    beings. But Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
    <p>
    “You 
    do not worship besides Him but only names which you have named (forged), you 
    and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. The command 
    (or the judgement) is for none but Allah. He has commanded that you worship 
    none but Him (i.e. His Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, 
    but most men know not.”</p>
    <p>
    [Yoosuf 
    12:40]</p>
    <p>
    “Say 
    (O Muhammad SAW): "I am on clear proof from my Lord (Islamic Monotheism), 
    but you deny (the truth that has come to me from Allah). I have not gotten 
    what you are asking for impatiently (the torment). The decision is only for 
    Allah, He declares the truth, and He is the Best of judges.”</p>
    <p>
    
    [al-An ‘aam 6:57].</p>
    <p>
    End 
    quote.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    
    Thirdly:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    Many 
    people think that the word democracy means freedom! But this is incorrect 
    because freedom is one of the by-products of democracy. What we mean by 
    freedom here is freedom of belief, freedom of decadence, and freedom of 
    expression, and these also have many negative impacts on Muslim societies, 
    because matters have gone so far that aspersions are cast upon the 
    Messengers and the messages, and upon the Qur’an and the Sahaabah, on the 
    grounds of freedom of opinion; and wanton display and uncovering are 
    tolerated, and indecent images and movies are propagated on the grounds of 
    freedom. Many such things are happening, of which there is a long list, all 
    of which are playing a part in the corruption of the ummah, morally and 
    spiritually.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    Even 
    that freedom for which countries are calling by means of democratic systems 
    is not absolute. We see whims and desires, and vested interests, behind the 
    limitations on those freedoms. At the time when their systems tolerate 
    aspersions upon the Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
    him) and the Qur’an, on the grounds of freedom of expression, we find that 
    this freedom is denied when speaking about matters such as the “Nazi 
    Holocaust of the Jews”! In fact anyone who denies this Holocaust is treated 
    as a criminal and put in prison, even though it is a historical matter that 
    may be denied.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    If 
    these people really are promoting freedom, then why do they not let the 
    Muslim peoples choose their own path and religion? Why did they colonize 
    their lands and play a role in changing their religion and beliefs? What do 
    these freedoms have to do with Italy’s slaughter of the Libyan people, or 
    with France's slaughter of the Algerian people, or with Britain’s slaughter 
    of the Egyptian people, or with America’s slaughter of the Afghan and Iraqi 
    peoples?&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    
    According to those who promote it, freedom may be subject to several 
    restrictions, including the following:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    1.
    
    The law. Man does not have absolute freedom to drive in the 
    opposite direction to traffic in the street, or to open a shop without a 
    license, and if he says “I am free,” no one will pay any attention to him.</p>
    <p>
    2.
    
    Custom. A woman in their countries – for example – cannot go 
    to offer condolences to the bereaved wearing a bathing suit. If she says “I 
    am free”, the people will look down on her and throw her out, because it is 
    contrary to custom.</p>
    <p>
    3.
    
    Public taste. One of them – for example – cannot eat and pass 
    wind in front of people, or even burp! The people will look down on him even 
    if he says, “I am free.”</p>
    <p>
    
    Furthermore, we say:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    Why 
    shouldn’t our religion restrict our freedom, as their freedom is restricted 
    by things that they cannot deny? Undoubtedly what is taught by Islam is that 
    which is in people’s best interests. If a woman is forbidden to make a 
    wanton display, or if the people are forbidden to drink alcohol and eat 
    pork, and so on, all of that is in their best interests, physically and 
    mentally, and for their general welfare. But they refused to restrict their 
    freedom if the injunction comes from religion, but they say “we hear and we 
    obey” if it comes from human beings like them or from a (man-made) law.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    
    Fourthly:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    Some 
    people think that the word democracy is equivalent to shoora (consultation) 
    in Islam! This is a mistaken notion for many reasons, including the 
    following:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    1.
    
    Shoora has to do with new matters that arise or with matters 
    that are not explained in detail in the texts of the Qur’an or Sunnah. With 
    regard to the “rule of the people”, the people may discuss what is 
    well-established in religion, which may lead to refusing to acknowldge the 
    prohibitions on that which is forbidden, and to forbidding that which Allah 
    has permitted or made obligatory. So the sale of alcohol is permitted 
    according to these laws, as are fornication/adultery and riba (usury), but 
    these laws put pressures on Islamic organizations and the activities of 
    those who call people to Allah. This is diametrically opposed to sharee‘ah, 
    so what does this have to do with shoora?</p>
    <p>
    2.
    
    The majlis ash-shoora (consultative committee) is to be 
    formed of people who have a deep knowledge of fiqh, Islam and sharee‘ah, 
    fahm, and have a high level of piety and good character. So no one who is of 
    bad character or foolish, or is a disbeliever or atheist, is to be consulted 
    or involved in the shoora process. As for the democratic councils of 
    representatives, they pay no attention to any of the con ditions mentioned 
    above. The representative may be a disbeliever, or of bad character or 
    foolish. What does this have to do with shoora as prescribed in Islam?
    </p>
    <p>
    3.
    
    Shoora is not binding upon the ruler; the ruler may give 
    precedence to the view of one member of the council that is supported by 
    proof, and prefer his view over that of the other council members, whereas 
    in the case of representative democracy, the agreement of the majority 
    becomes legally binding upon the people.</p>
    <p>
    Once 
    this is known, then what the Muslims must do is be proud of their religion 
    and trust that the rulings of the Lord are best for them in this world and 
    in the Hereafter, and they should disavow systems that go against the laws 
    of Allah.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    What 
    all other Muslims must do – rulers and ruled alike – is adhere to the laws 
    of Allah, may He be exalted, in all their affairs. It is not permissible for 
    anyone to follow a system or methodology other than Islam. One of the 
    indications of their acceptance of Allah as their Lord, Islam as their 
    religion, and Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) as their 
    Prophet and Messenger, is that the Muslims adhere to Islam outwardly and 
    inwardly; they respect the laws of Allah and follow the Sunnah of the 
    Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    We 
    ask Allah to honour us with Islam and to cause the plots of the traitors to 
    fail.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
    And 
    Allah knows best. </p>    </section>
